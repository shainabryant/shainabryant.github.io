# Make A Buck  
This is a game I have played with my students with actual playing cards. I thought it would be cool to make a digital version of it.


## Two Player Game 
- The user will play against the opponent (computer).


### Rules of the game
- The object of this game is to be the first to collect ten cards that exactly equal $1.00.
- This game is played using a complete deck of cards.
- In this game, Ace = $0.01, Two = $0.02, Three = $0.03, â€¦ Tens = $0.10, Jack = $0.11, Queen = $0.12 and King = $0.13.
- To begin, the opponent (computer) will shuffle the deck and deal ten cards to each player.
- Player and opponent then take turns drawing and discarding one card at a time until the deck of cards is depleted or someone collects exactly $1.00.


## Win State
- The first to collect ten cards that equal $1.00 wins that round and earns 1 point. 
- If no one has $1.00 after the deck is depleted, the person closest to $1.00 (without going over) earns 0.5 point.
- The player with the most points at the end of the last round wins the game. 


## Lose State
- If a player goes over $1.00, they will lose the round.
- If a player has a lesser total than the other player when the deck is depleted, they will lose the round.
The player with the lowest score when the game is quit is the loser of the game.


## Multiple rounds to play
- At the end of each round, the live player has the option to move to the next round or end the game. They will see the following prompt (or something similar): "Would you like to move to the next round or quit the game?")


## Technical Challenges
- shuffle cards

## Timeline 
- Wednesday - finalize proposal, create wireframe, videos and articles for tech challenges, create files (css, html, js), COMMIT!!
- Thursday - create psuedocode, create divs for the game, begin to gather game assets, COMMIT!!
- Friday - work on HTML & JS, COMMIT!!
- Saturday - work on HTML & JS, COMMIT!!
- Sunday - work on HTML & JS, start CSS, COMMIT!!
- Monday - finish styling with CSS, COMMITT!!, submit Github link (YOU DID IT! YAY!!)

### Note to Self: Ideas for Variation for later development
- To make the game a little easier, change the cards to whole number values and play to $100. For instance, Ace = $1, Two = $2 and so on.

- To make the game a little more challenging, use integer operations: make the black cards positive values and red cards negative values and play to zero.
